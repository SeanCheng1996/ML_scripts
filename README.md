These are notes on classical machine learning algorithms, based on COMP 540 at Rice University and  **Murphy**'s book, **Probabilistic Machine Learning**.

1. [Linear Regression.pdf](https://github.com/SeanCheng1996/ML_scripts/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression.pdf)
Including math formula, Probabilistic interpretation, MAP and Ridge regression.

2. [Linear classification.pdf](https://github.com/SeanCheng1996/ML_scripts/blob/main/2_Linear%20classification.pdf)
Really breif, just intution, more details are in the 3rd notes.

3. [Gaussian Discriminant Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/SeanCheng1996/ML_scripts/blob/main/3.%20Gaussian%20Discriminant%20Alanysis.pdf)
It contains the mathematical details about Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, including derivative deduction details.

4. [Kernel.pdf](https://github.com/SeanCheng1996/ML_scripts/blob/main/4.%20Kernel%20and%20SVM.pdf)
From the intuition of kernel trick to kernel method and kernelize linear regression.

5. [SVM(sparse kernel).pdf](https://github.com/SeanCheng1996/ML_scripts/blob/main/5.%20SVM(sparse%20kernel).pdf)
Support vector machine intuition and details.
